# Squiz-Game

This is my quiz, which has been created using HTML, CSS styles and JavaScript. I also created a function to locally store the Initials and score of the person attempting the quiz.

## Description

This Task meets the following acceptance criteria:

- When I click the start button, then a timer starts and I am presented with a question.
- When I answer a question, then I am presented with another question.
- When I answer a question incorrectly, then time is subtracted from the clock.
- When all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0, then the game is over.
- When the game is over, then I can save my initials and score.
